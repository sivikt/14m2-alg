general
=======

Repo mostly contains implementation of known algorithms, data
structures and other curious assignments.


edu-courses
===========

Repo contains source codes related to different online courses.
It's my own implementation of courses' exercises, assignments and
other curious tasks I had known from the courses. Also it contains
some of the courses study materials and reference implementations.

For example repo contains src related to Coursera courses. Remember
about Coursera Honor Code agreement and DON'T use it for "just to
pass the course". Knowledge are better than the score points.


goal
====
Self education and knowledge sharing.
