/**
 * """Idea.
 *     Best-first search. A solution to the problem that illustrates a general artificial intelligence methodology known
 *     as the A* search algorithm. We define a search node of the game to be a board, the number of moves made to reach
 *     the board, and the previous search node. First, insert the initial search node (the initial board, 0 moves, and
 *     a null previous search node) into a priority queue. Then, delete from the priority queue the search node with
 *     the minimum priority, and insert onto the priority queue all neighboring search nodes (those that can be reached
 *     in one move from the dequeued search node). Repeat this procedure until the search node dequeued corresponds to
 *     a goal board. The success of this approach hinges on the choice of priority function for a search node. We
 *     consider two priority functions:
 *
 *       - Hamming priority function. The number of blocks in the wrong position, plus the number of moves made so far
 *                                    to get to the search node. Intuitively, a search node with a small number of blocks
 *                                    in the wrong position is close to the goal, and we prefer a search node that have
 *                                    been reached using a small number of moves.
 *       - Manhattan priority function. The sum of the Manhattan distances (sum of the vertical and horizontal distance)
 *                                      from the blocks to their goal positions, plus the number of moves made so far to
 *                                      get to the search node.
 *
 *     We make a key observation: To solve the puzzle from a given search node on the priority queue, the total number
 *     of moves we need to make (including those already made) is at least its priority, using either the Hamming or
 *     Manhattan priority function. (For Hamming priority, this is true because each block that is out of place must
 *     move at least once to reach its goal position. For Manhattan priority, this is true because each block must move
 *     its Manhattan distance from its goal position. Note that we do not count the blank square when computing the
 *     Hamming or Manhattan priorities.) Consequently, when the goal board is dequeued, we have discovered not only a
 *     sequence of moves from the initial board to the goal board, but one that makes the fewest number of moves.
 *     (Challenge for the mathematically inclined: prove this fact.)
 *
 *     Detecting unsolvable puzzles. Not all initial boards can lead to the goal board by a sequence of legal moves,
 *     including the two below:
 *
 *     1 2 3                 1  2  3  4
 *     4 5 6 => unsolvable   5  6  7  8  => unsolvable
 *     8 7 -                 9  10 11 12
 *                           13 15 14
 *
 *     To detect such situations, use the fact that boards are divided into two equivalence classes with respect to
 *     reachability: (i) those that lead to the goal board and (ii) those that lead to the goal board if we modify the
 *     initial board by swapping any pair of adjacent (non-blank) blocks in the same row. (Difficult challenge for the
 *     mathematically inclined: prove this fact.) To apply the fact, run the A* algorithm simultaneously on two puzzle
 *     instancesâ€”one with the initial board and one with the initial board modified by swapping a pair of adjacent
 *     blocks in the same row. Exactly one of the two will lead to the goal board.
