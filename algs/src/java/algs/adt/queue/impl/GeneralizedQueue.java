/**
 * """Generalized queue.
 *    Design a generalized queue data type that supports all of the following operations in logarithmic time
 *    (or better) in the worst case.
 *      - Create an empty data structure.
 *      - Append an item to the end of the queue.
 *      - Remove an item from the front of the queue.
 *      - Return the i-th item in the queue.
 *      - Remove the i-th item from the queue.
 *
 *    Hint: create a red-black BST where the keys are integers and the values are the
 *          items such that the ith largest integer key in the red-black BST corresponds
 *          to the ith item in the queue.
