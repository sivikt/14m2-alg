/**
 * """
 * Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that
 * algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region
 * by extracting the smallest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a
 * heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the minimum.
 *
 * Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, it has the advantage of a
 * more favorable worst-case O(n log n) runtime. Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort.
 *
 * Heapsort was invented by J. W. J. Williams in 1964. This was also the birth of the heap, presented already by
 * Williams as a useful data structure in its own right. In the same year, R. W. Floyd published an improved version
 * that could sort an array in-place, continuing his earlier research into the treesort algorithm.
 *
 * Heapsort primarily competes with quicksort, another very efficient general purpose nearly-in-place comparison-based
 * sort algorithm. Quicksort is typically somewhat faster due to some factors, but the worst-case running time for
 * quicksort is O(n^2), which is unacceptable for large data sets and can be deliberately triggered given enough
 * knowledge of the implementation, creating a security risk.
 *
 * Thus, because of the O(n log n) upper bound on heapsort's running time and constant upper bound on its auxiliary
 * storage, embedded systems with real-time constraints or systems concerned with security often use heapsort.
 *
 * Heapsort also competes with merge sort, which has the same time bounds. Merge sort requires Î©(n) auxiliary space,
 * but heapsort requires only a constant amount. Heapsort typically runs faster in practice on machines with small or
 * slow data caches. On the other hand, merge sort has several advantages over heapsort:
 *   - Merge sort on arrays has considerably better data cache performance, often outperforming heapsort on modern
 *     desktop computers because merge sort frequently accesses contiguous memory locations (good locality of reference);
 *     heapsort references are spread throughout the heap.
 *   - Heapsort is not a stable sort; merge sort is stable.
 *   - Merge sort parallelizes well and can achieve close to linear speedup with a trivial implementation;
 *     heapsort is not an obvious candidate for a parallel algorithm.
 *   - Merge sort can be adapted to operate on singly linked lists with O(1) extra space. Heapsort can be adapted to
 *     operate on doubly linked lists with only O(1) extra space overhead.
 *   - Merge sort is used in external sorting; heapsort is not. Locality of reference is the issue.
 *
 * Introsort is an alternative to heapsort that combines quicksort and heapsort to retain advantages of both: worst case
 * speed of heapsort and average speed of quicksort.
 *
 * Not stable
 * Worst case performance      O(n log n)
 * Best case performance       O(n log n)
 * Average case performance    O(n log n)
 * Worst case space complexity O(1) auxiliary
