Acknowledgments
===============

All people how invented all that stuff that so important for real life.

Big thanks to [Robert Sedgewick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_\(computer_scientist\)) and
[Kevin Wayne](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/contact/) for their excellent well-known book series Algorithms!
Also I'd like to thanks for the open online courses on the online learning platform [Coursera](http://coursera.org),
namely Algorithms Part I and Part II, Analysis of Algorithms and Analytic Combinatorics.


Used materials
==============

Some of the materials from the courses are used in this learning rep. Primarily it's test data algs4-data.zip, standard
libs algs4.jar and stdlib.jar and interesting tasks and job interview questions which I tried to implemented on Java.
For those I strive to put original descriptions in Javadoc.
Also it contains reference implementation of algorithms and data structures.

I try to put sources for any description of any algorithm/data structure/problem implementation. If it absents then
probably I forgot to do it or compose it by myself.
